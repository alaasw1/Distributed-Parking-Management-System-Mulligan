Any comments or feedback on the assignmentâ€™s requirements or complexity (optional):
1.It is the most interesting project we had so far because it is on large-scale systems and everything work in distributed way!
2.It is hard concept but we will use every tool we have in hand to understand it.
3.We tried to make an executable jar of the javafx project using gradle but unfortunately it didn't work.
